This code repo contains all the source code used in evaluation of "A Cross-Layer Design For Enabling Stateful Mobile
Edge Applications Over 5G" paper.


1. **app_aware_5g_control_plane** folder contains source code related to the application-aware cellular control plane.
2. **carmap_with_edgecat** folder contains the CarMap application code modified with EdgeCat.
3. **emp_with_edgecat** folder contains the EMP application code modified with EdgeCat.
4. **state_migration_simulation_framework** folder contains the code used to simulate applications having diverse state properties.
5. **handover_prediction** folder contains the code related to handover prediction, target base station prediction, and pre-processing of the data sets used to evaluate the target bs prediction pipeline. The data set incldue radio traces collected in high-speed trains, driving tests and other miscellaneous mobility scenarios.
